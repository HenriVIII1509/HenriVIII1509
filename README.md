👋 Hey there! Welcome to my GitHub playground! I'm Cole, the brains behind the code at Inventiv Limited, a company I recently kicked off to bring digital dreams to life. 🚀

🌐 Doing the Web Dev Dance

I'm your go-to guy for web development wizardry. Whether it's crafting sleek front-ends or tweaking the gears in the back-end machinery, I'm all about making your digital presence pop.

💻 Getting Down and Dirty with Pixels

I'm deeply into the world of low-level graphical rendering. I enjoy getting hands-on with pixels, pushing their creative boundaries, and making graphics groove with efficiency. It's not just a job; it's my passion, and I absolutely love the pixelated journey! 🚀💻

🛠️ Tech Toys I Play With:

Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React, Vue.js)
Back-end: Node.js, PHP
Database: MongoDB, MySQL
Low-Level: OpenGL, Vulkan


Got a project that needs some Inventiv magic? I'm all ears! Feel free to drop me a line at cole@inventiv.uk.
